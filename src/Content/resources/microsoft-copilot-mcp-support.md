## Microsoft Embraces Model Context Protocol

In a significant move for enterprise AI integration, Microsoft has announced that Copilot will support the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the open standard created by Anthropic for connecting AI assistants to data sources.

## What This Means for Insurance Brokerages

This announcement is game-changing for the insurance industry. With MCP support in Copilot, brokerages can now:

- **Connect Legacy Systems** - Integrate Copilot directly with existing broker management systems (BMS) like PowerBroker, BMSS, and Applied Epic
- **Unified Data Access** - Access client data, policy information, and claims history through a single, standardized protocol
- **No More Data Silos** - Break down barriers between your BMS, accounting systems, and AI tools
- **Future-Proof Integration** - Build once, work everywhere - MCP connections work across multiple AI platforms

## How It Works

The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for AI assistants to:

1. **Discover** available data sources and their capabilities
2. **Query** information using natural language
3. **Execute** actions like creating quotes or updating policies
4. **Stream** real-time updates and notifications

Instead of building custom integrations for each AI tool, you implement MCP once and gain access to every AI assistant that supports the protocol.

## The BrokerDev Advantage

At BrokerDev, we've been building MCP servers for legacy insurance systems from day one. Our MCP implementation for broker management systems means you're already positioned to take advantage of this announcement.

When Microsoft rolls out MCP support in Copilot:

- ✓ Your BrokerDev MCP server will work immediately
- ✓ No additional integration work required
- ✓ Same data access you already have with Claude
- ✓ Unified experience across AI platforms

## What's Next

Microsoft's adoption of MCP validates what we've believed all along: standardized protocols are the future of AI integration. As more platforms adopt MCP, the value of your BrokerDev integration multiplies.

We're excited to see this ecosystem grow and to help insurance brokerages leverage these powerful new capabilities.
