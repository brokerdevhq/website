## Understanding Model Context Protocol

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to securely connect to your business data and systems.

### Why MCP Matters for Insurance Brokerages

Traditional insurance management systems like PowerBroker and BMSS contain decades of valuable data, but this data is trapped in legacy formats that modern AI tools can't easily access.

MCP solves this by providing a standardized way for AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot to:

- Query your data in natural language
- Access information securely without exposing credentials
- Work with your existing systems without requiring migration
- Maintain audit logs of all data access

### How It Works

MCP acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your data sources. When you ask an AI a question about your business data, MCP:

1. Receives the request from the AI assistant
2. Translates it into the appropriate query for your BMS
3. Retrieves the data securely
4. Returns it to the AI in a format it can understand

This all happens on your infrastructure, ensuring your data never leaves your network.
