## The Problem We're Solving

Insurance brokerages face a unique challenge: their most valuable asset—decades of customer data—is locked away in legacy systems that modern AI tools can't access.

Replacing these systems isn't realistic. Migration projects cost millions, take years, and carry enormous risk. But waiting for vendors to modernize means falling behind competitors who are already leveraging AI.

### Our Solution

BrokerDev bridges your legacy BMS with modern AI tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). No migration required. No data leaves your network. Your current system keeps working exactly as it does today.

### What This Means for Brokerages

With BrokerDev, you can:

- Ask AI assistants questions about your book of business in plain English
- Connect Power BI and Tableau directly to your data for real reporting
- Build custom tools like mobile apps and client portals
- Automate renewal analysis and identify cross-sell opportunities

### Early Access

We're working with a small group of brokerages to refine the platform. If you're interested in early access, [get in touch](/contact).

We're excited to help brokerages unlock their data and compete in the age of AI.
